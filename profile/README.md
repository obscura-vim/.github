      ObscuraVim is a deliberately minimal Neovim setup built for focused work: a quiet interface, explicit actions, and a workflow centered on search, keyboard control, and predictable tools. It exists to keep your attention on text and intent, not UI noise — fast to start, light to run, and honest about what it’s doing.
      <br /><br />
      If you want a configuration that feels like stock Neovim until you ask for power, ObscuraVim is the lean, disciplined baseline.
